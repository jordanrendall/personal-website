##Introduction

Who knew that I would love coaching so much? The responsibility and challenge to make the best of the day for so many people who are dependent on my decisions is not like anything I have experienced.

Sure, when I was rowing it was a little like that — the rest of my crew depended on me for my commitment, but I was not necessarily leading them. In my own way, I was a role model on the team in my later years but simply followed the training plan that was given; I did not do too much in the way of directly helping others get better. Part of me was worried they would become better than me or that my abilities would become lesser in comparison and obsolete.

##The Challenge

Coaching novice rowers has been an enlightening experience so far. The first couple of days, I had no clue as to how to explain everything and anything that comes as second nature to me when I am in a boat. This soon changed. I had a few days in a row where I was the only coach with the crew and had the space I needed to try to explain technique points in my own way. I am still always trying to be aware of how long I am preaching and if anyone has lost focus because of my rambling.

##Tools

I have set up a few tools to help me get better and find out what needs to change quickly and effectively.
<ol>
<li> I have created a weekly review Google Form. Here, I ask how they’ve been doing with sleep, fatigue, hydration and nutrition, but also what they think they’ve improved on, what they think they need to work on, questions, and general comments. It has been really helpful in identifying misunderstandings as well as bad habits in the team.</li>
<li> I have been taking and analyzing video whenever I can, and only reviewing the most recent video — not basing my opinion of their stroke off of a 2 week old video that is not relevant anymore. These rowers have only been in the sport for 3 weeks now! Their learning and skill development has been exponential. Slow motion video has been extremely helpful to me, and the team. To an individual, I can reference the difference in slow motion between phases of the stroke as well as compared to others in the boat.</li>
<li>I know it is not very innovative, but I formed a Facebook messenger group and a Facebook group to keep information flowing quickly and predictably to the athletes. They have been accustomed to getting important information from these sources and it has been working very well in that way.</li>
</ol>
##Race-day

We had our first race this past weekend and I was amazed at the way the crew organized themselves. They had never raced before but looked and sounded excited and confident in themselves. They are all very motivated and positive people so I can only take a bit of credit for their composure on race-day.

Our coxswains were impressed with the amount of knowledge we have shared with them over the past 3 weeks compared to the abilities of the other novice crews passing by throughout the day. It was heartwarming to see their surprise and recognition of what we are giving them.

##Beyond

I look forward to the coming weeks, where we build up to a peak at their first championship regatta at the end of October. I can already see myself coaching again — it is a challenge for me that gets me up in the morning ready to do what I can to help others. I can’t wait to see how they do and more importantly how they feel about rowing after our short season. My goal is to place well, but only as a result of being a close knit, happy, and healthy team that loves rowing.

Thanks for reading!
