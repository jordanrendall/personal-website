How do I determine what to write about? Should it just come to me naturally or should I seek it out? Can I continue the rhyme that I have laid out, or did I choose a sound that I cannot shout — from the rooftops, what is it I have here?

Is this a poem to revere or a song to be heard? Let me see what I can conjure. Can it stand the strength of my peers?

When I wake up in the world we call home, I get started with a sit and an ohm. Until you try it you will never atone, but it is not religious — I swear on my phone. Looking inward for the thoughts that may roam, letting them fly away, fly away home. Home to nothing, outside the dome, feeling release and a pure sense of calm.

Imagine a back beat, the beat of a drum. The snares are in full and the symbols sing on. All I wanted was a song of my own, my brother’s ahead and his fresh skills have shone. In order to leave without just dragging on, I will write but simply one more line from, where I feel my calm, where I feel at home, is where I am with her — with whom I am love.
