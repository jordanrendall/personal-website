Inspiration

I am taking inspiration from a friend who writes and uploads to the inter-webs a race report within a few days of each of his triathlons. Obviously, I have not followed the same timeframe, as we are approaching a full month past due. However, I will still go ahead with the exciting (for some, I hope!) tale of my race in Toronto that resulted in obtaining a qualification spot for the 2019 Age-Group World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Why the Toronto Triathlon Festival?

After placing second in my age group in Guelph at Guelph Lake I Sprint Triathlon, and third the following weekend in a World Championships qualification race in Welland at the Rose City Sprint Triathlon, I felt ready to add another race to my list and motivated to find another qualifier. The race in Welland only offered one qualification spot per gender, per age-group, and in coming third I did not qualify. I found the Toronto Triathlon Festival, which offered three automatic qualification spots per age group. I thought this could be my chance since I had been doing well enough so far and already learned from my mistakes in each race. I signed up late.

Pre-Race

I had stayed at my brother’s place in the city the night before after doing a practice swim and picking up my race kit (swim cap, race number/bib and having my number written on my arms). I made my way to Ontario Place for an 8AM arrival, the beginning of the open transition zone for Sprint athletes.

I was well fed, well hydrated, but had to grab a rain coat from my brother on the way out of the house — I am very grateful that I did! The forecast was a lot of rain and a heavy east wind.

Seeing the forecast, I knew I would need to push it on the bike up the false flat hill into the wind and aim for a speed of ~35kph, which I was able to maintain in training. On the way down the hill with the wind, I would need to book it and hold as high a speed as I could (I was hoping for ~50kph). The tail wind would make things feel easier and I knew I should accept the help but not allow myself to settle.

The wind would also affect my run, which was along the lakeshore. I figured I would need to push it hard on the first half of the run with the wind, and maintain my speed through the second half (but that it would be hard to do so).

Anyways, it was pouring rain throughout my time parking, grabbing my timing chip, placing my bike in transition, doing my warmup run, and putting on my wetsuit. So, when I went down to do my warm up swim, I was pretty cold. However, I knew I could handle a triathlon in the rain after my experience in Welland.

I went to the warm up swim area, which consisted of only 30m2 of space to share with probably 20 other athletes. I wanted to do around 250m of swimming as a warm up, and should have waited until there was less time until my start, but I was so cold that I felt like I could not wait any longer. I jumped in, 20 minutes before my race.

The paradox was that the more I warmed up, the less energy I would have for the race, but I needed to keep swimming to stay warm. I opted for less warm up but ended up very cold when I slipped back in before my start. The water temperature did not help, either. My hands and feet were cold from the ‘warm up’ swim.

I sat treading water for the few minutes before the start, thinking of my strategy: drafting when possible and advantageous, and cutting my own path when not — not to forget trying not to drown!

I inched forward a little as the countdown approached the gunshot start; I had placed myself off to the left to give myself a straight shot towards the first buoy. Some people were closer to the corner of the dock but would have to take the outside turn around the buoy. I was not sure what was a better option: to be swarmed on my way to the buoy or to be swarmed around the buoy. I opted for being swarmed around the buoy….

The Swim

The gun went off and I tried to find my own space in the first leg of the swim. That did not quite work out the way I planned — more people showing up in my category than I expected plus the cold water contributed to a sense of panic I thought I had overcome in Guelph. I was drafting a bit until the first buoy, but was becoming swarmed as I turned the corner.

I started to think my wetsuit was too tight around my neck, and was having trouble breathing. I grasped for my collar, trying to give myself some room to breathe, and started to think I might need to find a kayak support volunteer and quit.

Instead, I flipped on to my back and floated for a couple of breaths. This changed everything, since my heart rate came back down and I was able to get into my own groove. A few people passed me as I took my break, but I was able to gradually get through a couple on the rest of the swim.

One fun part of the swim — after my freakout — was finding that I was actually swimming in a straighter line than the people I was drafting. I drafted them when they were close, then they would veer off, and I would meet up to draft off them again after they corrected their course (in Welland, I had believed that I was not going to have a better course than anyone so I drafted the whole time).

I left the swim to the cheers of spectators, pulling off my swim cap, goggles, and ear plugs — yes, I cannot really swim without them!

Transition 1: Swim to Bike

I ran up a slight hill to the transition zone whilst undoing my wetsuit zipper, sliding the sleeves off my arms and down to my waist. I found my bike quickly — it helps that I am in the youngest age group regarding bike racks (29 and under), since they are usually close to the bike exit.

When I made it to my bike I slid the wetsuit down the rest of the way and the body glide I had applied helped my feet slip out quickly.

I put on my sunglasses, put on my race belt on the right direction — clipped in front of me so that I could actually see the clip as I tried to close it — and tried to clip on my helmet.

The helmet has been a struggle for me in all my races so far. I can never seem to clip it on quickly after the swim! I think this is the biggest time waster for me in the swim to bike transition.

I had my bike shoes clipped into my bike already, with elastic bands holding the shoes in a horizontal position. Once I had my helmet, I started the run with my bike out and up a pretty steep pavement ramp to the mount line.

The Bike

I stopped momentarily to jump on to my bike and start pedalling right away with my feet on top of my shoes. The elastics broke right away — great — but I could not get my feet into the shoes easily! Since the shoes had sat in the rain while I swam, the insoles scrunched up when I tried to put my feet in. I had to pull over to a stop to fix it.

The rest of the bike was smooth. I knew that the first half would be slightly uphill on the Gardiner Expressway, into a strong wind, and that the way back would be with a ripping tail wind. I pushed to maintain my goal of ~35kph into the wind and &gt;45kph with the wind. This was my first race with my triathlon bike (time trial style with built in aerodynamic handle bars and aerodynamically shaped tubes), and it paid off. I was able to manage a pretty quick speed, about 2-3 kph faster than my previous races on my road bike.

Apparently, I passed 61 people in the overall placing in just the bike alone. I made it up to the no-passing zone on the bridge towards transition, unclipped while riding, hopped off, but my shoes started bouncing off the ground. One of them unclipped and I had to stop and grab it. At that point, I reached down and unclipped the other shoe and began running with them in my hands — so awkward — while going downhill, barefoot, on wet pavement, trying not to come toppling down.

Transition 2: Bike to Run

I again found my transition spot easily and made sure to rack my bike before unclipping my helmet — Welland taught me this tidbit. I did not have as much trouble with my helmet as in Transition 1, but as in all of my races so far, I was slightly falling over while trying to put my running shoes on. My legs were wobbly from pushing on the bike, and my heart was racing — it was hard to slow things down, even though I reminded myself near the end of the bike to use two hands per shoe and take a second to breathe in the upcoming transition.

I had placed my running shoes in a plastic bag to keep them from becoming too wet, which was a good idea. However, I tried putting the second shoe on while it was still in the bag and it stuck to my foot as I tried to leave my transition spot. I shook my foot to get it off and wasted a few seconds.

The Run

I exited transition at a good speed following another speedy competitor, to the comments of a slower runner ahead of us who exclaimed, “Wow, you guys are insane!”

My goal was to use the wind as much as I could on the way out, then to push on the way back. I managed to stay between 3:45 and 4:00 per kilometre and looking to each runner ahead of me as my next target.

The first half of the run was smooth and I was able to hold speed right from the start as opposed to Guelph where it took me some time for my body to understand what I was doing to it.

On the way back, I saw a younger runner — possibly my age (a major target if I wanted to place top 3 in my age group) — up ahead by about 500 metres.

I kept my eye on him, and slowly chipped away at the distance. At about 2 kilometres to go, I knew that I would need to put in work to pass him before the ~750 metre mark or else I would probably be neck and neck in a sprint right at the line.

I picked it up to about 3:40/km and took more ground to get myself close to him, then overtook him with around 1.5 kilometres to go. I got some distance, then relaxed to about 4:00/km.

With about 750m to go, I heard footsteps and turned to see he was right on my tail. I dropped the hammer and brought my speed back to 3:40/3:45 per kilometre. I instantly created another gap, and held the pace through to the line.

In the end, I was only ahead of him by 3 seconds, placing 3rd in my age group (M25-29) and securing a qualification spot for Age Group World Championships next fall in Switzerland. So, I am glad I raced the way I did!

Conclusion

I had a lot of fun racing in downtown Toronto and being able to make a weekend out of it with my brother. My 3rd place finish secured me a qualification spot for Age-Group World’s in Switzerland next year in the Sprint distance triathlon. I have a good year of learning ahead of me and hope to make large gains in my swim and transitions, while pushing for strength on the bike and speed on the run.

Thanks for reading!
